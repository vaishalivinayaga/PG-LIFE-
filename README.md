PG-LIFE

The project was to create a PG-Life Web Application. First dashboard and index setup were done through HTML. Various properties/PGs available,
location, cost, pictures etc. was added into the database element. Next, I setup the DBMS part by creating the database and giving the ideal design to it by adding entities like users, testimonials, amenities, properties. Different types of tables were created using MySQL and implemented. Later using PHP, I created the Sign-up / Login Modal. Signup modal was to allow them to create a new account if they don’t have and log in modal allowed users to exiting account by checking with the database and matching their details. 
Home page search feature was also done so as to fetch the list of the corresponding PGs to a city which the user will enter in the search bar and when a user clicks on
the search button i.e., basically submitting a form - it takes the user to a page i.e. property list page. I also created the Footer modal in which 4 cities were
there so as to choose in which city they want a PG. Next was the major step in which I used JS and AJAX to code and set up the interface completely.
Later using react I fixed the UI and added data for final deployment.
Finally, my website – PG LIFE was deployed.
